It contains two projects first - HBaseStargate, main library, and second - HBaseStargateUsage, a few samples showing how to use HBaseStargate API

If you want run this you have to:
1. run hbase and change host and port variables
2. create 'users' table in hbase, for this task you can use *insertScritp.txt* in main folder
